`astroterm` is a terminal-based celestial viewer written in `C` using `ncurses`. It displays the real-time positions of stars, planets, constellations, and more, all within your terminal—no telescope required! Configure sky views by date, time, and location with precise ASCII-rendered visuals. See [usage](#usage) for all supported options!

`astroterm` is constantly improving, and we'd love to hear your ideas! If you have a suggestion or find a bug, please open an issue and share your feedback.

    ```sh
    wget -O astroterm "https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases/latest/download/astroterm-<os>-<arch>"
    ```

   - Replace `<os>` with the appropriate platform:
     - **Linux:** `linux`
     - **macOS:** `darwin`
   - Replace `<arch>` with the appropriate architecture:
     - **Linux:** `x86_64` (arm64 support to come after [Ubuntu arm64 runners](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/arm64-on-github-actions-powering-faster-more-efficient-build-systems/) are avilable)
     - **Apple Silicon (M-series):** `aarch64`
     - **Intel-based Macs:** `x86_64`
   - To view all supported combinations, see the [Releases](https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases) page.

2. Run the executable

    ```sh
    chmod +x ./astroterm
    ./astroterm
    ```

#### Windows

1. Download the latest `.exe` file using PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest`:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases/latest/download/astroterm-win-x86_64.exe" -OutFile "astroterm.exe"
    ```

2. Run the `.exe`

    ```powershell
    .\astroterm.exe
    ```

### Nix (coming soon)

Astroterm will soon (hopefully) be available for Nix users! Follow [this open PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/373316) to track its progress and updates. To help speed up the process, consider adding a 👍 reaction to the PR.

In the meantime, you can build from source by following the [Building from Source](#building-from-source) instructions if none of the other methods suit your needs.

## Building from Source

### Linux, macOS & WSL

#### Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When building, you must install the _development_ version of the runtime requirements, which provide the headers and libraries necessary for compiling and linking. These packages are typically marked with a `-dev` or `-devel` suffix.

- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
- C compiler
- [`meson`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) 1.4.0 or newer ([installation via python](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#installation-using-python) is recommended)
- [`ninja`](https://repology.org/project/ninja/versions) 1.8.2 or newer
- [`ncurses`](https://repology.org/project/ncurses/versions) library
- [`argtable2`](https://repology.org/project/argtable2/versions)
- Some common CLI tools
  - [`wget`](https://repology.org/project/wget/versions) or [`curl`](https://repology.org/project/curl/versions)
  - [`xxd`](https://repology.org/project/xxd/versions) (is also commonly packaged with [`vim`](https://repology.org/project/vim/versions))

> [!WARNING]
> `ncurses` and `argtable` detection is spotty on some systems, and you may need to install
> [`pkg-config`](https://repology.org/project/pkg-config/versions) in order
> for Meson to find them.

> [!TIP]
> See [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) for how `astroterm` is built and tested on Ubuntu via GitHub Actions.

#### Install

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm && cd astroterm
  ```

2. Download star data:

  ```sh
  curl -L -o data/bsc5 http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/BSC5
  ```

3. Build:

  ```sh
  meson setup build
  meson compile -C build
  ```

You may now run the generated `./build/astroterm` binary or add the `astroterm` command system-wide via `meson install -C build`. Pressing <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>ESC</kbd> will exit the display.

### Windows

> [!WARNING]
> Building on Windows is more involved than other platforms.

#### Requirements

- [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) (Other C compilers currently don't work)
- [`meson`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) 1.4.0 or newer ([installation via python](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#installation-using-python) is recommended)
- [`ninja`](https://repology.org/project/ninja/versions) 1.8.2 or newer
- [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for embedding data during build)
- [`pdcurses`](https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses/tree/master/wincon)*
- [`argtable2`](https://github.com/jonathanmarvens/argtable2)*

> [!WARNING]
> *These libraries must be compiled locally and moved to where Meson expects them to be. See [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml#L98) for how this is done.
>
#### Install

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm && cd astroterm
  ```

2. Download star data:

  ```sh
  curl -L -o data/bsc5 http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/BSC5
  ```

3. Build:

  ```sh
  meson setup build
  meson compile -C build
  ```

> [!TIP]
> Some steps must be done in the [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt and Developer PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022), so it's best to just do everything there.

## Usage

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Options

The `--help` flag displays all supported options:

```text
Usage: astroterm [OPTION]...

  -a, --latitude=<degrees>  Observer latitude [-90°, 90°] (default: 0.0)
  -o, --longitude=<degrees> Observer longitude [-180°, 180°] (default: 0.0)
  -d, --datetime=<yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss>
                            Observation datetime in UTC
  -t, --threshold=<float>   Only render stars brighter than this magnitude
                            (default: 5.0)
  -l, --label-thresh=<float>
                            Label stars brighter than this magnitude (default:
                            0.25)
  -f, --fps=<int>           Frames per second (default: 24)
  -s, --speed=<float>       Animation speed multiplier (default: 1.0)
  -c, --color               Enable terminal colors
  -C, --constellations      Draw constellation stick figures. Note: a
                            constellation is only drawn if all stars in the
                            figure are over the threshold
  -g, --grid                Draw an azimuthal grid
  -u, --unicode             Use unicode characters
  -q, --quit-on-any         Quit on any keypress (default is to quit on 'q' or
                            'ESC' only)

  -r, --aspect-ratio=<float>
                            Override the calculated terminal cell aspect ratio.
                            Use this if your projection is not 'square.' A value
                            around 2.0 works well for most cases
  -h, --help                Print this help message
  -i, --city=<city_name>    Use the latitude and longitude of the provided city.
                            If the name contains multiple words, enclose the
                            name in single or double quotes. For a list of
                            available cities, see:
                            https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/blob/main/data/

### Example

Say we wanted to view the sky at 5:00 AM (Eastern) on July 16, 1969—the morning
of the Apollo 11 launch at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. We would run:

```sh
astroterm --latitude 28.573469 --longitude -80.651070 --datetime 1969-7-16T8:00:00
```

Finding the precise coordinates can be cumbersome, so we could also use the nearest major city to achieve a similar result:

```sh
astroterm --city Orlando --datetime 1969-7-16T8:00:00 -m
```

While we're still waiting for someone to invent time travel, we can cheat a little by using [Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org/skysource/UpsPeg?fov=185.00&date=1969-07-19T09:00:00Z&lat=28.47&lng=-80.56&elev=0) to confirm that this aligns with reality.

If we then wanted to display constellations and add color, we would add `--constellations --color` as options.

If you simply want the current time, don't specify the `--datetime` option and
`astroterm` will use the system time. For your current location, you will still
have to specify the `--lat` and `--long` options, or provide the nearest city with the `--city` option.

For more options and help, run `astroterm -h` or `astroterm --help`.

> [!TIP]
> Use a tool like [LatLong](https://www.latlong.net/) to get your latitude and longitude.

> [!TIP]
> Star magnitudes decrease as apparent brightness increases, i.e., to show more stars, increase the threshold.

## Troubleshooting

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Release Won't Download via Curl

For some reason, `curl` does not follow the latest release redirect. Use `wget`
to download the latest release or hardcode the tag in the link using `curl`. Or,
just download via the [releases page](https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases).

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Broken Unicode on Linux

If Unicode characters do not display correctly in the terminal, you may need to configure your system's locale to support Unicode.

1. Temporarily set the locale (add this to `.bashrc` or equivalent to permanently enforce)

  ```bash
  export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
  export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
  ```

2. Install and configure locales (example for Ubuntu/Debian)

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y locales
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
  ```

  During configuration, select `en_US.UTF-8` as the default locale.
